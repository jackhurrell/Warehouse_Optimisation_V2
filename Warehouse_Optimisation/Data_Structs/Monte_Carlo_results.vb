' Description:
' This structure captures the results from Monte Carlo simulations for supply
' chain optimization. It stores various metrics including service levels, 
' reorder paths, and associated costs (storage, reorder, lost sales).
' most values are double nested loops. Each values in the firest level represents a
' new simulation. The second level represents each warehouse. The order the warehosue values
' are given in is stored in the variables Warehouse_order
